I'm a 3D Applied Scientist at [Amazon Imaging Science](https://www.amazon.science/), in New York. 
My research focuses on devising new methods to reconstruct 3D objects from a set of sparse visual inputs.

Before joining Amazon, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Graphics at the [Geometric Computing Lab](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/) 
at [New York University](file:///C:/Users/panch/Documents/Workspaces/panchagil/nyu.edu) under the supervision of [Denis Zorin](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~dzorin/).

I earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [Universidad Catolica de Chile](http://www.puc.cl/), where I worked with Prof. Miguel Nussbaum. 
My master thesis was awarded the Roberto Ovalle Aguirre Award (Best Thesis Project) in 2012, by the Institute of Engineers of Chile.

I have a strong background in linear algebra, computational geometry, and 3D visualization. 
My research interests are in 3D modeling, interactive computer graphics, and creativity. 
You can see my publications below and other interesting projects I worked on.
